Palindrome Checker

Return true if the given string is a Palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and
backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumerical characters(Punction,
spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case(lower or upper)
in order to check for palindromes.

We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as racecar, RacerCar and raceCAR among others.

We'll also pass strings special symbols, such as 2A3*3a2, 2A3 3a2, and 2_A3*3#A2.
